The Design System by Fannie Mae, called FDS, creates a unified experience that embodies a consistent look and feel. FDS provides a central repository for both internal and external teams to build consumer-grade digital products in a scalable and repeatable way. 

FDS is a living, breathing document that contains all of our visual assets (components, iconography, color palettes, grids, etc) and code.
